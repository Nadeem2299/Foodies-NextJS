Server vs Client component
1. React Server component (RSC)
    components that are only rendered on the server
    by default, all react components(next js apps) are RSCs
    advantages- less client side js,
    faster page loads, SEO benefits

2. Client component
    components that are pre-rendered on the server but then also potentially on the client
